{"name":"Dun Duh! ","tagline":"Welcome to my life!","body":"### Hello! My name is James!\r\nHello, my name is James or RubyOnRails(I don't know ruby though). I am 14 years old and I live in a small town in California. I love computers and always have loved them. My first computer was a old Mac computer and I played and played. I have a major passion for video games and that is what puts me were I am today. I love making websites and making games. I have made 2 games in my life. One is a jumping game and the other is a Combat game which is being developed. \r\n### School life!!!\r\nI was never the \"best attitude\" child. I was sent home a lot and I was even put in the special education because I was not smart enough. Then by 5th grade I was taken out of Special Education and the teacher said \"James there is no way you will be a smart 5th grader.\" and I guess she was right, I was an extremely smart 5th grader I graduated with a 4.0 and I was happy I have lived out my life and here I am now. I am a pretty cool web developer.   ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
